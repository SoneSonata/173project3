        <p>
            The goal of this assignment was to create a website for a fictional establishment, in my case an art gallery. It needed to have numerous different pages with different layouts.

        <h2>Project Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            When I was making this I really focused on simple but tasteful since that's what I thought a gallery would focus on. I spent a lot of time making the artists pages. I was super proud of myself for getting a lightbox to work since this was before I even knew javascript.

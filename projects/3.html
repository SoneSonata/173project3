        <h2>Project Mission</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I needed to create a working photo gallery that would cycle through a folder of images using javascript. The page also needed to be formatted so it would still function without javascript turned on.

        <h2>Project Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            We were given an option with this project to try and work with multiple albums and I immidiatly wanted to attempt this. At first it was a challenge to get things working the way I wanted but once I figured it out, It was easy and turned out really good.
